# Automation of Spectrophotometry Data Analysis

**Name**: Rachel Veenstra <br>
**Semester**: Spring 2019 <br>
**Project Area**: Agronomy

## Objective

Create a Python function to collect and analyze data from absorbance analysis of ureides, nitrates, and soluble carbohydrates for easy analysis in the KSU Crops Lab.

## Outcomes

I want this function to produce .csv files with results for sample analysis of ureide, nitrate, and soluble carbohydrates using values generated and exported via Excel files to the computer by the spectrophotometer in the lab. I also want my function to generate a graph to plots points along the results curve and color them in red or green depending on if they are acceptable values or if the samples need to be re-run. Formulas for manipulating data and generating models will be listed [here](https://github.com/Rachel-Veenstra/Semester-Project/tree/master/Formula-Listing). All of these are currently embedded in an Excel file provided to me by the lab.

## Background and Rationale

Ureide, nitrate, and soluble carbohydrate analysis are common tests run by researchers in the KSU Crops Lab. Currently, there are Excel sheets for each parameter generated by the machine when samples are run, which contain an identification number and the absorbance value for the sample. These values are automatically saved on a lab computer and then must be manipulated into the correct Excel file to create concentration and curve-fit values based on formulas embedded in the Excel sheet. This is not a huge inconvenience to our lab scientists, but they agree that a code with this function would be beneficial to streamline the process and automate lab analysis procedures. Automation is key to increasing effiency and reducing error in lab environments.  Ideally, I would like to take information directly from the machine with my code so that no additional inputs are necessary to generate final analysis values.
